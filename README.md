## How to run a monthly meeting

At the start of the meeting, assign one person to be the meeting coordinator. The meeting coordinator will be responsible for taking notes and ensuring that all meeting attendees participate in the meeting.

> :exclamation: Assign meeting coordinators so that the same individuals are not always coordinators to ensure that everyone shares the role.

At the start of the meeting, the meeting coordinator will make a copy of the [MEETING-MINUTES-TEMPLATE.md file](./MEETING-MINUTES-TEMPLATE.md) file and fill in the appropriate fields.

The meeting coordinator will ask each attendee to share updates on what they are working on or questions/ideas they would like to propose. The meeting coordinator will note these conversations in the minutes.

After the meeting, the meeting coordinator will create a new file with a `MM-DD.md` file name for the meeting date and submit a pull request adding it to the associated year.

> :bulb: For efficiency, the meeting coordinator can use the [Add file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) feature in GitHub to add a new file with the appropriate name in the matching directory. When adding the new file, be sure to use the template in the [MEETING-MINUTES-TEMPLATE.md](./MEETING-MINUTES-TEMPLATE.md) file.

### Attendees
- Matt Seal
- Kyle Kelley
- John Swanke
- Vivek Pradhan

### Notes
- Kyle: Upgrade RxJs to 7 PR up
    - Helpful for kernel management
    - Bit of a yack-shave due to typescript upgrade
    - Vivek: Would upgrade have cascading impacts?
        - Kyle: It's a major package upgrade, but it's unclear how much change it would facilitate. Rx aliases and Kernel socket management are impacted the most.
        - Looking for a good migration guide
- Matt: related but not tied to nteract, nbconvert 6.1.0rc0 is released with 8 months of changes
- Matt: papermill had a few organizational and error related changes merged
- Matt: Carol is working on some dataexplorer improvements
- Vivek: Contributing docs are a bit weak for onboarding new users. Where should we improve things?
    - John: Windows setup in particular are not working out-of-the box.
    - Matt: Make any contribution that helps, most of the original the devs are not on Windows so we missed guidance on this front in the past.
- John: Working on cell-split-merge. PR for actions / reducers, then a PR for how to expose these in nteract.

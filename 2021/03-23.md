### Notes
- Carol
    - Reviewed Jerome's changes and approved them! Thanks!
- Matt
    - Spent some time on testbook.
    - You might run into a problem in IPyKernel where it aborts running for the next 100 milliseconds. It seems to be trying to address shaky networks, but it's causing latency-based problems.
    - You can manually set this to 0sec to fix it for now. That's what he did for testbook.
- Jerome
    - Would like docs work merged. Has the permissions to do it, but hasn't merged to this organization yet and doesn't want to break anything.
    - Talked to Safia about changing the theme for docs because of trouble with the code blocks. Material theme might be the change?
    - After this PR, we can do smaller PRs to fill in the pieces that are still missing (particularly with mythic right now).
    - Great work! :tada: 
- Isabela
    - Jupyter community calls no longer conflict with this meeting time! They've been moved to 8am Pacific starting at the next call on Tuesday, March 30th.

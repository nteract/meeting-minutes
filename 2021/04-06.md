### Notes

- Matt
    - Did a release for papermill a few weeks ago that fixes a language check error. You can also overide the language now.
    - Made a PR that fixed the IPykernel issue that was breaking testbook or similar things that run cells sequentially because of a delay in running a cell across an error. Should appear in the IPyKernel 6 release.

- Jerome
    - PR is in! [Docs are live](https://docs.nteract.io/)! :tada: Thanks to Carol for the feedback.
    - Still working on Myths and needs feedback to better understand what it is and its uses. 
    - Matt can review [this](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5485/files) PR
    - Matt can also get Jerome in contact with some other developers that know more about Myths to keep this working moving forward.

- Vivek
    - Also very excited about the docs!
    - Would like feedback on a [PR for updating the monaco editor package](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5484) and a failing test.
    - Matt thinks it's a transitive error not based on anything happening in this PR.
    - [Monaco editor webpack plugin to monaco editor version matrix](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin#version-matrix)

- Isabela
    - Does anyone know what accessibility tests nteract uses?
    - Not immediately, so she will look into it more. Maybe [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)?

- Rohit
    - Looking for feedback on a PR.

- Amin
    - Saw the message on Hydrogen about looking for a primary maintainer and is interested.
    - Should we change the codebase to typescript? It would be a big change but might help make some fixes easier long term. We could use [flow-to-ts](https://github.com/Khan/flow-to-ts/)
    - Matt says next steps are probably to talk to community members more involved with Hydrogen and make sure that changes like that would fit.

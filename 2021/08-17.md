    - Wants to present on collaboration and ask for feedback on how to contribute such a large amount of code. 
    - Thinks phases might be ideal, but open to feedback or references.
    - Submitted [#5585](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5585) for a start
    - Demonstrated current work and typing in a collaborative notebook locally. Hooray!
    - On a basic level, this catches all changes sent to the editor.
    - This implementation does require some sort of credentials for user authentication. Maybe via GitHub?
    - Hoping to demo again in a few weeks!

### Notes

- Presentation from Alex Panov, Microsoft Engineer for Collaboration (Live Share, etc.)
- Introduce an RTC approach for nteract
- Expressed interest at [nteract/nteract #5327](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/5327)
- [Slides](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?resid=8B03473766D69DC5!91404&ithint=file%2cdocx&authkey=!AMTxSyxs9DedoSQ)
- [Historical Doc on Server Side Models for RTC by Kyle, Safia, and Carol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQeESzUZzcyCWauJ5noOpkGkz8gStjqi3XXYyc474M4/edit#heading=h.qwd6unhppdnd)
- This proposal does not rely on a single implementation library. 
- Focus on content not kernel interactions
- Aims to introduce a new mythic package to set up a foundation for real time collaboration to backend to connect to.
- Notebook Actions / Redux not covered here but anticipate it will be a Redux middleware
- Backend: GraphQL to Distributed Data Structure Store (Fluid Foundation structures)
    - Queries
        - Greater control of which cells to get and display rather than the entire notebook
    - Mutations
    - Subscriptions
        - Subscribe to a cell event
        - Receive async iterator
        - Dispatch redux action on event firing
        - - Events related to cell metadata and output are included
- UX components (TBD)
    - Considering avatars, statuses, and presence indicators
- Roadmap
    - 1. RTC mythic package
    - 2. GraphQL schema
    - 3. Custom middleware that helps communicate existing nteract actions to and from RTC backend
    - 4. UX components
- Q&A
    - What would stay in REST and what would be GraphQL?
        - Contents API would gradually be replaced, but kernel interactions would stay the same(?)
    - Is GraphQL the communication protocol while Fluid is the structural coordinator?
        - Yes exactly
    - Is Fluid the same tech used in LiveShare?
        - No LiveShare is proprietary and Fluid is OSS and they don't share code
    - How does distributed state have conflicts resolved?
        - Fluid backend handles the conflict resolution (wasn't clear to me how the end document state would end up), but can be an abstraction for the conflict resolution implementation.
        - [Fluid framework syncedObjects](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/react/src/syncedObjects)
        - [OT Experimental](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/experimental/dds/ot/ot)
- Demo
    - Side by side of same notebook and how changes are reflected
    - Shows current GraphQL implementation
    - Using [Fluid framework](https://fluidframework.com/)

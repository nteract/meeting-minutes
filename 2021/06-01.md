### Notes
- Shibani
    - [Kernel Status seems to represent both the server as well as the client states for the kernel](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/discussions/5552) 
    - Matt says this is rooted in a larger Jupyter problem, so this can only be partially fixed on nteract for now. This may change if the JupyterLab community ends up noticing a similar problem with their RTC implementation.
    - We also may have complications from the RTC proposal for nteract as well. 
    - Assuming nothing is going to change immediately, the best action might be to clearly define the action paths.
